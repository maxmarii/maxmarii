**Hi, everyone!I'm Maria**

Well, I'm Maria and I'm 27 years old.
I wanted to write a fun description to make you laugh but, unfortunately, I'm not _so_ funny.
So, I will do a _standard_, _boring_, _short_ description of myself  (spoiler: it won't be).

--- 
I previously got a bachelor's degree in Biological Science at Università degli Studi di Palermo.
Actually I'm attending a bachelor's degree in Software Engineer at Università degli Studi di Palermo. 
I want to be a Bioinformatician, so that's why I chose this path.

What else?

I _love_ pets and I have a dog named Grace, I like listening to music, watching anime and movies, reading books I _love_ soccer/football. I cheer on Inter Milan. 
Last, but not least, I _love_ videogames, in particular Japanese RPG and retrogaming. I love Final Fantasy Saga and I'm Final Fantasy X expert. That's why you see Yuna's propic in my social, even in GitHub. She's like me, after all.

Thanks for reading
